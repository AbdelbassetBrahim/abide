<p>There is no consensus on the best methods for preprocessing resting state fMRI data. Rather than being prescriptive and favoring a single processing strategy, we have preprocessed the data using four different preprocessing pipelines, each of which was implemented using the chosen parameters and settings of the pipeline developers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io/abide/ccs.html">Connectome Computation System (CCS)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io/abide/cpac.html">Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (CPAC)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io/abide/dparsf.html">Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io/abide/niak.html">Neuroimaging Analysis Kit (NIAK)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The preprocessing steps implemented by the different pipelines are fairly similar. What varies most are the specific algorithms used for each of the steps, their software implementations, and the parameters used. The following sections provide an overview of the different preprocessing steps and how they vary across pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="processing-strategies">Processing strategies</h3>

<p>Each pipeline was used to calculate four different preprocessing strategies:</p>

<p>For strategies that include global signal correction, the global mean signal was included with nuisance variable regression. Band-pass filtering (0.01 - 0.1 Hz) was applied after nuisance variable regression.</p>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p>A transform from original to template (MNI152) space was calculated for each dataset from a combination of functional-to-anatomical and anatomical-to-template transforms. The anatomical-to-template transforms were calculated using a two step procedure that involves (one or more) linear transform that is later refined with a very high dimensional non-linear transform. When data are written into template space (typically after the calculation of derivatives, except for NIAK) all transforms are used simultaneously to avoid multiple interpolations.</p>

<h2 id="derivatives">Derivatives</h2>

<p>Statistical derivatives (e.g., regional homogeneity) were generated from preprocessed functional data for each of the four processing strategies generated from each of the four processing pipelines. As mentioned earlier, these derivatives were all generated using CPAC. Although the calculation of the derivatives were the same for every pipeline, there were differences in each pipeline as to when each derivative was registered to standard space and when smoothing was applied. In every case the final resolution of the calculated derivatives is 3x3x3 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<h3 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h3>

<p>For CCS, CPAC, and DPARSF, the derivatives listed below were calculated in native space using unsmoothed functional data. The results were then written into template space (MNI152) and spatially smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. The registration and smoothing were performed using steps specific to each pipeline.</p>

</ul>

<p>In contrast, the derivatives listed below were calculated on the unsmoothed functional data in template (MNI152) space and then smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.</p>

</ul>

<p>Note as mentioned earlier VMHC was calculated on the functional data registered to the symmetric standard MNI152 brain.</p>

<h3 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h3>

<p>In the NIAK pipeline, the functional data was written into template space and spatially smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel prior to calculating the statistical derivatives.</p>

<h3 id="a-nameregionsofinterestregions-of-interesta"><a name="regions_of_interest">Regions of Interest</a></h3>

<p>We also extracted mean time-series for several sets of regions-of-interests. In each case, the mean time-series was taken from functional data already registered in standard space for every pipeline. More specifically, time series were extracted for seven ROI atlases:</p>

A grey matter mask was constructed by averaging individual-level grey matter masks derived by automated segmentation. Individual-level connectivity graphs were constructed by treating each within-gm-mask voxel as a node and edges corresponding to super-threshold temporal correlations to the voxels’ 3D (27 voxel) neighborhood. Each graph was partitioned into 200 regions using normalized cut spectral clustering. Association matrices were constructed from the clustering results by setting the connectivity between voxels to 1 if they are in the same ROI and 0 otherwise. A group-level correspondence matrix was constructed by averaging the individual level association matrices and subsequently partitioned into 200 regions using normalized cut clustering. The resulting group-level analysis was fractionated into functional resolution using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Labels were generated for each of the resulting ROIs from their overlap with AAL, EZ, HO, and TT atlases using the cluster naming script distributed with the <a href="http://ccraddock.github.io/cluster_roi/atlases.html">pyClusterROI toolbox</a>.
